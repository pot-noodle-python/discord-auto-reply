# purchase updated version: Discord - Swanky#6710
## Overview

This app will allow you to automatically reply to DMs on discord with a custom AFK message. It will also reply to pings in discord servers with the same message. The app allows you to:

- Pick a start and end time when you want the app to operate.
- Choose a custom message to use.
- View a history of recent messages the app has replied to.
- Pause/Resume the app when you want

An executable has been created and now can be downloaded from the releases section

## Installation

Download the executable file from the releases section:

- Because this code uses your token to interact with discord, your operating system may identify this as a virus.
- In your browser, change your download safety settings to allow you to download unsafe software
- Turn off your antivirus or make an exclusion for this software.
- If you need any help getting this started. Please refer to my discord.
